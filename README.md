# Web_Programming_Final

README - 

This is my run tracker web app.  You can put in your distance and time and get your minutes per mile!  There is a makeshift username system, enter “James” as your username to get it to work.  While not a proper username system, it’s there to show that the rest of the code is written in such a way where one could be implemented.

The site is also nearly entirely dynamically created from JavaScript.  There is code that is commented out that can be used to transfer each run to JSON format, if I decide to run this on a server and give people a personalized experience where their runs are saved.

The CSS is fairly simple and some styling was done inside JavaScript.
